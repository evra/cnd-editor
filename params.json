See [screenshots](https://github.com/evra/cnd-editor/wiki) \r\n\r\nThe editor is based on [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) and can be used to build other DSL which need to reference CND.\r\nFor example one can reuse CND grammar to build jcr content descriptor DSL. It can be also used for java code generation using\r\n[xtend](http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/) language (for example POJO classes generation based on node type definitions).\r\n\r\n\r\nStatus \r\n--\r\nThe project is in beta phase however the editor is stable and has most of the features required to create complex CND files. \r\nBug reports, feature requests, merge requests are wellcome.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n--\r\nThis is an eclipse plugin and requires eclipse 4.3 (Kepler). \r\n\r\nYou can use our eclipse update site [http://dl.bintray.com/evra/eclipse](http://dl.bintray.com/evra/eclipse). \r\nRelease information is also available at our [bintray page](https://bintray.com/evra/eclipse/cnd-editor).\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can install the package manually from github:\r\n* Download the latest [release](https://github.com/evra/cnd-editor/releases) package.\r\n* Install the package using the eclipse update manager: Help -> Insall new software -> Add -> Archive -> Select downloaded package\r\n* Select \"JCR CND Editor Feature\", select \"Contact all update sites during install to find required software\" \r\n* Click finish and restart eclipse.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n--\r\nSee [dev README](/releng/com.evrasoft.jcr.repository.parent/README.md) how to setup dev environment and start extending the editor.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
