Prerequisites:

- Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers (version 4.3 Kepler)
- Maven 3

1. Clone the git repository into {projectRoot}
2. Prepare target platform - go to /releng/com.evrasoft.jcr.repository.parent and run mvn package
3. Generate CND source files - got to /releng/com.evrasoft.jcr.parent and run mvn
	This step is optional, you can do it in eclipse using "Generate Language Infrastructure (com.github.evra.jcr.cnd)" launch.     
4. Start eclipse and import all projects from {projectRoot}
5. Add target platform 
	* Preferences -> Plug-in development -> Target Platform -> Add -> Select "Nothing"
	  -> Add -> Software Site -> Add -> Local 
	* Select folder {projectRoot}/releng/com.evrasoft.jcr.repository/target/repository/
	* Select all artifacts
	* Make sure the following checkboxes are checked "Include required Software" "Include Source if available"
	* Click Finish
	* Select the created target platform as active
6. Generate CND infrastrucure (required if you did not run maven package on step 3)
	* Run MWE2 launch: "Generate Language Infrastructure (com.github.evra.jcr.cnd)"
7. Rebuild workspace

Note: 
Source folders generated by xtext (src-gen, xtend-gen) should not be put under source control rather generated by maven or MWE2 launch.
